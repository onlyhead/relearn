## Core Concepts

### The RL Framework

```
Agent <---> Environment

Agent:
- Observes state (s)
- Takes action (a)
- Receives reward (r)
- Observes next state (s')

Goal: Learn policy π(a|s) that maximizes expected cumulative reward
```

### Key Terms

- **State (s)**: Current situation/observation
- **Action (a)**: Decision made by the agent
- **Reward (r)**: Feedback from environment
- **Policy (π)**: Strategy for choosing actions
- **Value Function (V)**: Expected future reward from a state
- **Q-Function (Q)**: Expected future reward from a state-action pair
- **Episode**: Complete sequence from start to terminal state
- **Discount Factor (γ)**: How much we value future vs immediate rewards

---

## Model-Free Value-Based Methods

These methods learn to estimate the value of states or state-action pairs without explicitly modeling the environment.

### Q-Learning Family

#### 1. Q-Learning
**Core Idea**: Learn Q(s,a) = expected future reward from taking action a in state s

**Update Rule**:
```
Q(s,a) ← Q(s,a) + α[r + γ max Q(s',a') - Q(s,a)]
                                a'
```

**Key Properties**:
- **Off-policy**: Can learn optimal policy while following different policy
- **Model-free**: No environment model needed
- **Guaranteed convergence**: Under certain conditions

**When to Use**:
- Discrete state/action spaces
- When you can explore freely
- When you want robust, well-understood algorithm

**Example Scenario**: Game AI (chess, Go) where you can try different moves

#### 2. SARSA (State-Action-Reward-State-Action)
**Core Idea**: Like Q-learning but uses actual next action instead of max

**Update Rule**:
```
Q(s,a) ← Q(s,a) + α[r + γQ(s',a') - Q(s,a)]
```

**Key Properties**:
- **On-policy**: Learns about the policy being followed
- **More conservative**: Accounts for exploration in learning
- **Better for risky environments**: Won't learn overly aggressive policies

**When to Use**:
- When exploration is costly/dangerous
- When you want policy to account for its own exploration
- Safety-critical applications

**Example Scenario**: Robot navigation where dangerous moves should be avoided

#### 3. Expected SARSA
**Core Idea**: Uses expected value over all possible next actions

**Update Rule**:
```
Q(s,a) ← Q(s,a) + α[r + γ ∑ π(a'|s')Q(s',a') - Q(s,a)]
                            a'
```

**Key Properties**:
- **Best of both worlds**: More stable than SARSA, more principled than Q-learning
- **Policy-aware**: Considers probability of each action
- **Often superior performance**: Empirically outperforms both Q-learning and SARSA

**When to Use**:
- When you want stability and performance
- When you have well-defined exploration policy
- General-purpose learning

#### 4. Double Q-Learning
**Core Idea**: Uses two Q-functions to reduce overestimation bias

**Why Needed**: Standard Q-learning tends to overestimate values due to max operation

**Key Properties**:
- **Reduced bias**: More accurate value estimates
- **Better final performance**: Less overoptimistic policies
- **Slight computational overhead**: Maintains two Q-tables

**When to Use**:
- When overestimation is problematic
- In noisy environments
- When you need accurate value estimates

### Advanced Value-Based Methods

#### 5. R-Learning
**Core Idea**: Optimizes average reward instead of discounted reward

**When to Use**:
- Continuing tasks (no terminal states)
- When long-term average performance matters
- Resource allocation problems

#### 6. Hysteretic Q-Learning
**Core Idea**: Different learning rates for positive vs negative prediction errors

**When to Use**:
- Non-stationary environments
- Multi-agent settings where other agents are learning
- When environment changes over time

---

## Model-Free Policy-Based Methods

These methods directly learn a policy without going through value functions.

### Core Concepts

**Policy Parameterization**: π(a|s; θ) where θ are learnable parameters

**Policy Gradient**: Update θ in direction that increases expected reward
```
∇θ J(θ) = E[∇θ log π(a|s; θ) * R]
```

### Algorithms

#### 3. Trust Region Policy Optimization (TRPO)
**Core Idea**: Constrain policy updates to trust region

**Key Properties**:

- **Good performance**: Often better than REINFORCE

**When to Use**:
- When you need guaranteed improvement
- Research settings
- When computational cost is not primary concern

---

## Model-Free Actor-Critic Methods

Combine value-based and policy-based methods by learning both policy and value function.

### Core Concepts

**Actor**: Policy π(a|s; θ) that selects actions
**Critic**: Value function V(s; φ) or Q(s,a; φ) that evaluates actions

**Advantage**: A(s,a) = Q(s,a) - V(s) = "how much better is this action than average"

### Algorithms

#### 1. A2C/A3C (Advantage Actor-Critic)
**Core Idea**: Actor uses advantage from critic for updates

**A2C vs A3C**:
- **A2C**: Synchronous updates
- **A3C**: Asynchronous parallel workers

**When to Use**:
- Good balance of sample efficiency and stability
- Continuous action spaces
- When you want both policy and value estimates

#### 2. Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG)
**Core Idea**: Actor-critic for continuous actions with deterministic policy

**Key Properties**:
- **Deterministic policy**: μ(s) instead of π(a|s)
- **Experience replay**: Reuses past experiences
- **Target networks**: Stable learning

**When to Use**:
- Continuous control (robotics, games)
- When actions are deterministic
- High-dimensional action spaces

#### 3. Twin Delayed DDPG (TD3)
**Core Idea**: Improvements to DDPG addressing overestimation and brittleness

**Key Improvements**:

- **Target policy smoothing**: Regularization

**When to Use**:
- Instead of DDPG in most cases
- Continuous control tasks
- When you need reliable continuous control

#### 4. Soft Actor-Critic (SAC)
**Core Idea**: Maximum entropy RL - maximize reward and entropy

**Key Properties**:
- **Entropy regularization**: Encourages exploration
- **Sample efficient**: Often better than TD3/DDPG
- **Stable**: Less hyperparameter sensitive

**When to Use**:
- Most continuous control tasks
- When exploration is important
- When you want sample efficiency

    // Key differences from Q-learning:
    // - On-policy updates: learns about policy being followed
    // - Uses actual next action (not max): more conservative
    // - Better for stochastic policies and risky environments
    
    void update(StateType s, ActionType a, double reward, 
                StateType s_next, ActionType a_next) {
        // Q(s,a) ← Q(s,a) + α[r + γQ(s',a') - Q(s,a)]
    }
};
```

    // Bayesian exploration strategy
    // - Maintains posterior distributions over Q-values
    // - Samples from posterior for action selection
    // - Optimal exploration for multi-armed bandits
    
    struct BayesianQFunction {
        std::unordered_map<std::pair<StateType, ActionType>, 
                          std::pair<double, double>> posterior_params; // mean, variance
        double sample_value(StateType s, ActionType a);
        void update_posterior(StateType s, ActionType a, double reward);
    };
};
```

#### 4.2 Information Gain Exploration
```cpp
template <typename StateType, typename ActionType>
class InformationGainExploration {
    // Active learning approach to exploration
    // - Selects actions that maximize information gain
    // - Maintains uncertainty estimates over value function
    // - Balances exploration and exploitation optimally
    
    double compute_information_gain(StateType s, ActionType a);
    ActionType select_action_by_information_gain(StateType s);
};
```

## Technical Implementation Details

### 1. Header-Only Design Considerations

**Challenge**: AI-Toolbox separates declarations and implementations
**Solution Strategy**:
```cpp
// All implementations in header files
template <typename StateType, typename ActionType>
inline void Algorithm<StateType, ActionType>::complex_method() {
    // Implementation here - inline for header-only
}

// Template specialization for performance-critical paths
template <>
inline void Algorithm<int, int>::optimized_method() {
    // Specialized implementation for common types
}
```

**Memory management**:
- Smart pointers for complex data structures
- RAII principles for resource management
- Template-based memory pool allocation for performance

### 2. Enhanced Template Design Patterns

**Current Pattern**:
```cpp
template <typename StateType, typename ActionType>
class Algorithm {
    // Basic template approach
};
```

**Enhanced Pattern with Strategy Injection**:
```cpp
template <typename StateType, typename ActionType, 
          typename ExplorationStrategy = EpsilonGreedy,
          typename ValueFunction = SparseQTable>
class Algorithm {
    ExplorationStrategy exploration_strategy;
    ValueFunction value_function;
    
    // Configurable components through template parameters
    // Policy injection for maximum flexibility
    // Strategy pattern for extensibility
};
```

**Benefits**:
- Compile-time optimization of strategy selection
- Zero-cost abstractions for performance
- Extensible design for new strategies
- Type safety for component interactions

### 3. Multi-Agent Architecture Decision

**Evaluation of Options**:

**Option A: Separate Multi-Agent Namespace** ✅ **Recommended**
```cpp
namespace relearn::multi_agent {
    template <typename StateType, typename ActionType>
    class JointActionLearner { /* ... */ };
    
    template <typename StateType, typename ActionType>
    class SparseCooperativeQLearning { /* ... */ };
}
```

**Advantages**:
- Clear separation of single-agent vs multi-agent concerns
- Dedicated data structures for joint action spaces
- Specialized coordination algorithms
- Easier maintenance and testing
- Better documentation organization

**Option B: Template Specialization**
```cpp
template <typename StateType, typename ActionType, bool IsMultiAgent = false>
class QLearning {
    // Conditional compilation based on IsMultiAgent
    // Unified interface but complex implementation
};
```

**Disadvantages**:
- Complex conditional compilation
- Mixed concerns in single class
- Harder to maintain and understand
- Limited flexibility for multi-agent specific features
